	<h2>For my mom, my friend, my angel., <br> Thank you for being my mom. I just wanted you to know that I appreciate every small act of kindness that you present to me each day (Whether I show it or not). I am extremely grateful for everything that you do for me. Whether that be bringing clothes to school for me when I forget them, or helping me with figuring out who I am. That you for nurturing me from that very first second of my life, and thank you for being my closest advisor. Sorry if I drive you crazy sometimes, but I only do it because I love you. You’re my one and only mom, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for you. Thank you for everything that you have done for me!!<br> With love, <br> Your favorite child, <br> Alex</h2>
