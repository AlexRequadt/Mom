		<h2>To my mom, my friend, my angel, <Br> I just wanted to start off by letting you know how much you mean to me. Momma, you are my world, there are girls, and there are guys in my life, but they are always temporary. You momma are always by my side no matter how difficult it may seem for you to stay there. I appreciate everything that you do for me. Whether it be helping me with laundry, or bringing my clothes to school when I forget them, I appreciate it (Whether I show it or not). I am sorry if I drive you crazy some times, but I only do it because I love you. You’re my one and only mom, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for you. Enjoy this day where you can finally be appreciated for all that we know you do for us!! Thank you Mom for everything!!...<br> With love, <br>from your favorite child, <br> Alex,</h2>
